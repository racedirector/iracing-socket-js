# Examples
The following examples may/may not:
  - include every consumer that is decided to be included in the library.
  - work for all use cases.
  - actually help you and you lap time.
  - _work_ at any given time.

The examples are given as a best practice for how to consume the library, any major interface
changes will be documented and kept up to date in the following exmaples as migration guides.

Help applying the library to your (`js`) use case is much appreciated, and will be rewarded with faster
lap times from the racing gods.

Please enjoy :)
